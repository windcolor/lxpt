Availability Calendar 7.x-4.x
=============================

Incompatibilities with 7.x-3.x:
-------------------------------
These are actions and checks you have to perform manually after you have
upgraded to this version.
- Clear all caches.
- Date formats are now customisable: customise (admin/config/regional/date-time
  and admin/config/regional/date-time/locale) them to your likings and check all
  your date handling and displaying parts to see whether they are still working
  as expected.
- Visit and save the "field settings" and "manage display" pages for all
  calendar fields and define whether they are day or overnight based.
- Visit and save the "field settings" and "manage display" pages for all booking
  formlet fields and check whether the new settings are better suited to your
  use case.
- Theming: check if all your custom styling still applies correctly. E.g., the
  buttons for the booking formlet are changed into <button>s; classes and other
  attributes have changed for several elements.
- Periods: the 2nd date of a period is either inclusive (day rental) or not
  inclusive (overnight rental, typically the "departure" date). In 7.x-3.x, the
  2nd date was always not inclusive. Test and check that every part is still
  working as expected.
- Booking formlet to webform POST: the arrival and departure fields are renamed
  to from_display and to_display. You have to update the default values for the
  elements that receive these values in the (or all in a multilingual site)
  webform. I.e: change "%post[arrival]" to "%post[from_display]" and change
  "%post[departure]" to "%post[to_display]".
- Booking formlet to webform POST: there are additional fields that now get
  posted: %post[from_iso] and %post[to_iso]. See the readme (of booking formlet)
  for an explanation of these values and their differences with from_display and
  to_display.
- API and JavaScript changes. Almost all API and JavaScript functions have been
  changed. Sometimes just slightly, sometimes they are completely rewritten or
  even replaced. If you have done custom coding: test it all. API changes are
  not separately described, they are part of the items in the change log below
  that is grouped by issue (feature/bug) not by API function.
